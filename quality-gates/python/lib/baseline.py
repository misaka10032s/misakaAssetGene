"""Generic version-controlled baseline-diff helper, shared by every gate that needs
"fail only on NEW findings relative to what already existed on this tree" (G1 ruff, G2 mypy;
G4's check_import_cycles.py predates this shared module and keeps its own inline copy of the
same idea — see that file's docstring).

Ported from D:/backup/CSIA/.WEB/learningMachine/api/quality-gates/lib/baseline.py (verified
recipe) — kept identical in spirit.

A baseline is a JSON array of violation *identity strings* — a stable key built by the
caller from fields that survive line drift (e.g. "relative/file.py|CODE|message text"),
deliberately EXCLUDING the line number so a violation that merely moved a few lines because
of an unrelated edit above it doesn't register as "new". Two violations with the same
identity are indistinguishable and collapse to one baseline entry — acceptable for this
recipe's scale (a few hundred pre-existing findings, not thousands).
