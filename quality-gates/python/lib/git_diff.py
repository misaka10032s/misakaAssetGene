"""Shared diff-scoping helper for the diff-based gates (G3b assertion-presence, G5 diff
coverage). Every gate that needs "only what changed" uses this so the definition of "changed"
stays identical across all of them.

Ported from D:/backup/CSIA/.WEB/learningMachine/api/quality-gates/lib/git_diff.py (verified
recipe), adjusted for this repo's main branch name (`main`, not `master` — see `git remote
show origin` / `.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`).

Scope model (deliberately simple): the base ref is the merge-base with `main`, and "changed"
means "working tree right now vs that merge base" (``git diff <base>``, no upper bound). That
single definition covers committed-on-branch, staged, AND unstaged-but-tracked changes in one
pass. Override with ``QUALITY_BASE_REF`` for a narrower/explicit comparison.

Known gap (inherited from the ported recipe): a brand-new file that has never been `git add`-ed
is invisible to plain ``git diff <base>`` — it is NOT "unstaged", it is untracked, and this
helper does not add ``--others``/``--include-untracked`` to pick those up. A gate run against
such a file silently reports "nothing to check" rather than checking it. In practice this
self-heals the moment the file is staged (the cluster's own workflow stages before every
gate/commit run), so it is not fixed here — flagged rather than silently left inaccurate.
